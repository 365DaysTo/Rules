# Rules
Group Study Rules for "365DaysTo"

1. You can study alone or with friends, we highly recommend to form a study group =)
2. Create a repo called something in the likes of "365DaysToWhaterverYouWantToStudy" 
3. Use your repo to add daily notes of your studies using markdown files day by day, actually, create a folder for every day, it will be useful in the future
4. Push your notes or practice code/projects to github every day.
5. Take study time alone or with your group everyday (we recommend +2hs daily)
6. Tweet your count every day, like Day 1/365 of... and use the hashtag #365DaysTo, also you can create your own one like #365DaysToGoogle if for example you're studying to get a job at google.
7. Enjoy the process!
